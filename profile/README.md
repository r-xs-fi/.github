High-quality packages?
======================

**All packages** meet the following standards:

- Easy usage instructions included. [Example](https://github.com/r-xs-fi/ltunify)
- Smallest possible base (preference order: 1) scratch 2) alpine 3) something bigger)
- Runs as unprivileged user, exceptions are [clearly documented](https://github.com/r-xs-fi/ltunify/blob/9a658193129fef6db47dc8bbf83164aab91fdcc5/Dockerfile#L11-L12).
- Built for multi-arch, if reasonably easy
- Versioned tags
- High-quality metadata
- (TODO) Automatically updated on a schedule
- (TODO) All builds are tested to a "container starts and stays up" standard, sometimes further
- (TODO) Vanity URL (`r.xs.fi/<package name>`)
