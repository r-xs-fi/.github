High-quality packages?
======================

**All packages** meet the following standards:

- Easy usage instructions included
- Smallest possible base (preference order: 1) scratch 2) alpine 3) something bigger)
- Runs as unprivileged user
- Automatically updated on a schedule
- Built for multi-arch, if reasonably easy
- Versioned tags
- High-quality metadata
- Vanity URL
- All builds are tested to a "container starts and stays up" standard, sometimes further
